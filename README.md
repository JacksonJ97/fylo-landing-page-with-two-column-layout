## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced SCSS by styling and laying out elements for a landing page. I learned how to use JavaScript DOM manipulation to display a message when the "Get Started" buttons were clicked. I used regex to validate the email in order to display a certain message for the different outcomes. Although validating emails on the cilent side is not recommended, I did it solely for the purpose of the UI/UX.
